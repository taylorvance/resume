Projects

Docker + Serverless — Infrastructure overhaul

Migrated a high-maintenance server-based monolith to a containerized,
auto-scaling, self-healing platform using Docker and ECS/Fargate.
Reduced compute costs by 10% and virtually eliminated operational
overhead.
Executed the migration in-place during business hours with zero downtime
or maintenance window and no impact to users.

AI Code Documentation and Q&A Tool — AI-powered support assistant

Built an LLM-based tool that auto-generates natural-language technical
documentation for arbitrary codebases and enables semantic search via
vector embeddings.
Users can ask questions about the application (e.g. “How does this
feature work?” or “Why did X happen when I did Y?”) and get context-rich
answers.

The Bridge — Data sync layer for application migration

Architected a resilient, eventual-consistency pipeline leveraging AWS
SNS and SQS for asynchronous data transformation.
Pipeline processed 500k–1M daily events with ~10s latency, enabling
seamless parallel use of both legacy and new applications during an
extended migration period.

Billable Items — Line-of-sight to upcoming revenue

Replaced a fragile, opaque billing process with a robust, reliable,
auditable system that provides clear visibility into upcoming revenue.
Billable items are updated automatically, as billable actions occur in
the system, ensuring accurate and timely billing.

Loops — Internal notification system

Built a notification/messaging system in our staff application to reduce
email clutter.
My first solo project, completed while new to the company and tech
stack, delivering value within weeks of joining.
